  <h2>Hamline University redesign</h2>

    <em>Old Hamline site:</em><br />

    <p><strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong> In 2010, Hamline University's website was still stuck in 2004, with a content management system that hadn't been actively supported by its parent company since 2005. With over 100 active editors  and little centralized oversite, the pagecount had ballooned to over 18,000 pages (not including .pdfs and pages on other servers or subdomains). The navigation and architecture were similarly out-of-control, making it difficult if not impossible for prospective students to find the content they were looking for. In particular, the old homepage included a Flash banner that was impossible to update and a dearth of space for marketing/promotional messages.</p>
    <p><strong>THE SOLUTION:</strong> I designed and implemented a complete overhaul to the Hamline University website, creating a high-quality design and enrollment-supporting navigation structure that advances the needs of the university. The overhaul included template redesign, new interactive elements, a migration to a new content management system, and a ground-up rebuild/rethink of all sections and pages. I was the functional lead for all front-end, user experience, information architecture, branding, design, and content strategy elements. As a result:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Redesigned homepage and persistent navigation drive 243% more traffic to admission sites.</li>
    <li>Final site is friendly, inviting, and engaging, earning a B+ from <a href="http://educheckup.com/2011/06/20/hamline-university-episode-252/" title="EDUCheckup Episode #252: Hamline University" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'external', 'click', 'EDUcheckup']);">EDUcheckup</a> with scores of 93 and 94 for design and content.</li>
    <li>Total number of pages was reduced from 18K to 5K.</li>
    <li>SEO best practices were implemented, drastically improving internal and external search results.</li>
    <li>Project was completed on time and with a high degree of accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

	<em>Redesigned Hamline MBA site:</em><br />
    <a href="http://www.hamline.edu/mba" title="Redesigned Hamline MBA site" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'external', 'click', 'Hamline-MBA']);"><img src="img/Hamline-MBA.png" width="300" height="200" alt="Image of new MBA site" /></a>

    <p><strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong> Increasing enrollment in <a href="http://www.hamline.edu/mba" title="Redesigned Hamline MBA site" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'external', 'click', 'Hamline-MBA']);">Hamline's MBA program</a> was a top priority for the 2011-2012 academic year, but the program's website  lacked in key areas. The old MBA site did not have its own left navigation; MBA-specific links were buried well below the fold, hidden in small text in the right column. Site search data in Google Analytics confirmed that visitors struggled to find key information such as tuition rates, which weren't discoverable on the MBA site. </p>
    <p><strong>THE SOLUTION:</strong> I designed and implemented a major redesign of the MBA site's navigation and content. Based on our knowledge of prospective student goals, we  knew prospective applicants prioritized tuition, outcomes, and day-to-day &quot;How do I fit this into my life?&quot; program details. I recommended and implemented the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Conceptualized and strategized an MBA-specific left menu, with sections for degree info, tuition and financial aid, and admission.</li>
    <li>Swapped the old text-heavy  template with a rotating banner template, creating more high-profile opportunities to market specific elements of the program.</li>
    <li>Highlighted content on the homepage that appeared frequently in internal search data: tuition, assistantships, program schedule.</li>
    <li>Incorporated  graduate testimonials and embedded videos of former students and faculty talking about the benefits of the program.</li>
    </ul>

<p><strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong> My graduate documentary class needed a web presence to share our articles on biofuels and alternative energy in Iowa. Our class was made up of a dozen students with various technology comfort levels. With a short deadline, it was important to set up something that not only was professional and appropriately branded, but also easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>THE SOLUTION:</strong> I volunteered to lead the creation, design, and installation of <a href="http://www.imagingiowa.org" title="Imaging Iowa" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'external', 'click', 'Imaging-Iowa']);">Imaging Iowa</a>, our class website. I chose to install WordPress as a content management system, so individuals could post their own articles and photos. I installed a pre-built WordPress template and made significant stylesheet modifications to brand our mission and identity appropriately.</p>
    

  <h2>Sarah Barrow LLC</h2>

    <p><strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong> I needed a design, structure, and strategy for my online portfolio site which would display examples of my previous work in web design, user experience, digital marketing, and photography. As a professional web designer, I also wanted to show my hand-coding mastery, as many previous sites were built and managed through a content management system. My portfolio site also would serve as a testing ground for new technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3, which I was limited from using in my professional work.</p>
    <p><strong>THE SOLUTION: </strong>I strategize, design, and develop the website for <a href="http://www.sarahbarrow.com" title="Sarah Barrow" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'internal', 'click', 'home']);">Sarah Barrow LLC</a>. I hand-code all content and pages, incorporating HTML5 and CSS3 elements where possible. I structured the site into three categories of professional expertise: web design and user design, digital marketing campaigns, and photography and design. To simplify updating efforts, I chose to host my photography and design samples through Flickr.</p>
