    <h1>Digital Marketing Campaigns</h1>

    <p>My digital marketing experience includes strategizing, planning, executing, and measuring search engine marketing, social, and email campaigns.</p>


      <h2>Online Ads and SEM</h2>

    <p>I am responsible for designing, building, and implementing Hamline University's online display ad campaigns and social media ad campaigns. I help measure key performance indicators for display, social, and pay per click campaigns. I also monitor budgets for social media ads daily and ensure that landing pages are optimized for conversions. Recent successes include:</p>
    
   <h3>Summer enrollment push</h3>
   <p>Hamline implemented a multi-channel campaign to increase enrollment in summer courses. I led the digital portion of the campaign, including redesigning the summer term site, implementing rotating promo tiles on Hamline's homepage, and pushing out a Facebook ad campaign to incoming transfer students, transfer students at other universities, and adults looking for personal growth opportunities nationwide. This campaign resulted in:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Over 1,750 clicks on Facebook ads through May 1, with 91% of those new visits</li>
 <li>Total traffic to summer term site increased by nearly 660%</li>
 <li>Enrollment in summer term courses increased by 30% over the previous year, bringing in approximately $300,000 in revenue for the university</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>Search Engine Optimization and Keyword Research</h2>
 <p>At Hamline I am responsible for search engine optimization and keyword research. There are four simple tactics that get you 80% of the way to full optimization:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>URL structure</li>
 <li>Page title</li>
 <li>Header tags</li>
 <li>Keyword metadata</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>The key is to make sure that the right keywords appear in those four areas on the specific, related page on your site. Don't spam your page with your keywords! Use them in those four areas and in your page content sparingly and you'll make huge strides in your search engine optimization. And how do you know what keywords you should use? Keyword research is the foundation to proper search engine optimization -- make sure you use a tool like Google Keywords to see what phrases potential visitors use.</p> 
  
  <h2>Email Campaigns</h2>

    <p>I lead Hamline's web team in strategizing, planning, and executing email marketing campaigns to prospective undergraduate and graduate students. I ensure that emails incorporate the branding and design of coordinating print pieces, such as paper invitations, postcards, and brochures. I rewrite email content as necessary to emphasize calls to action and optimizing click-through rates. I also monitor email performance post-send.</p>


<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>The most important component of a digital marketing campaign isn't the design, writing, or particular channel used: it's the resulting data. A solid grasp of web traffic data is essential when you're putting money into various tactics; it helps drive smart adjustments to a campaign, evaluate a channel or tactic, and increase marketing efficiency.</p>
<p>I am a proficient web data analyst with experience in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up goals and analyzing goal conversions</li>
<li>Tracking campaigns across channels</li>
<li>Using web traffic data to measure success of a redesign</li>
<li>Multivariate (A/B) testing</li>
<li>Social media analytics, including which indicators to obsess over and which to ignore</li>
<li>Email open and click-through rates</li> 
<li>Using the above to make strategic decisions about websites and campaigns</li>
</ul>
