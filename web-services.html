<h1>What can I do for you?</h1>
   	<section class="service indent">
   		<div class="ss-layout"><h2>Design</h2></div>
       	<p>First, it's most important to identify what your goals are. Then, we move into the nitty of what you were thinking.  From wireframes (aka pre-design, to Photoshop and other Adobe products, to optimizing images, and everything in between. In the web world these days, "designers" aren't often "developers". </p>
   	</section>

   	<section class="service">
   		<div class="ss-navigateleft"><h2>Coding</h2></div>
       	<p>HTML/CSS, HTML5/CSS3 (yep, all the fancy stuff), LESS, JQuery plugins, content management systems, installing Wordpress, uploading final files to your hosting service. Does it need to be responsive? I can do that. Do you need to be able to update it yourself? Of course you do! I can help with that as well.</p>

    <section class="service indent">
    	<div class="ss-users"><h2>Usability</h2></div>
        <p>Usability (or user experience) ensures that visitors (potential customers) have a positive, easy experience with your site. It's not just if they can do what you want them to do... can they do what they are looking to do? Navigation, site structure, functionality (clicks), wayfinding, user tasks,  etc.</p>

   </section>
        
  <aside id="affordable">
  		<h1>Worried about cost?</h1>
