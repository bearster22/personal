<h1>What can I do for you?</h1>
   	<section class="service indent">
   		<div class="ss-layout"><h2>Design</h2></div>
       	<p>Website design is more than just colors and graphics these days: it also includes low- and high-fidelity prototypes, branding and visual identity systems, and typography. I am fluent in all of the above.</p>
   	</section>

   	<section class="service">
   		<div class="ss-navigateleft"><h2>Coding</h2></div>
       	<p>I hand-code HTML/CSS and HTML5/CSS3. I'm comfortable with JQuery and Javascript. I've worked in several content management systems, including Wordpress. I even have a little PHP thrown in there for good measure.</p>
   	</section>
    
    <section class="service indent">
    	<div class="ss-users"><h2>Usability</h2></div>
        <p>Usability (or user experience) means making sure that your users have a positive, easy experience with your site. It's an integral part of the design process and includes navigation, site structure, functionality, wayfinding, user tasks,  etc.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="service">
   		<div class="ss-connection"><h2>Strategy</h2></div>
       	<p>Not sure where to start? Let me help. I can help you distill what your goals are and translate those into the components you need. My strategy work also includes user analysis, best practices, opposition research, and a plan for ongoing maintenance.</p>
   </section>
        
  <aside id="affordable">
  		<h1>Worried about cost?</h1>
      	<p>Don't be. Gone are the days where you need to spend thousands of dollars to get a high-quality site. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of tools that help keep time (and therefore cost) to a mimimum. Throw your number at me and let's see what we can do!</p>
  </aside>       
   
  <section class="service indent">
   		<div class="ss-quote"><h2>Content</h2></div>
       	<p>Content strategy is the next big buzzword in the web world. Are you connecting your website to your email marketing, your tweets, your Facebook posts, to make sure you're driving conversions? I also partner with the best copywriters in the business. </p>
   </section>
   
   <section class="service">
   		<div class="ss-search"><h2>SEO/SEM</h2></div>
       	<p>Search engine optimization includes keyword research, making sure your page titles, headers, and description are up to par. SEM is search engine marketing: Google Adwords, PPC, display ads (design and strategy), landing pages, conversion.</p>
   </section>
    
   <section class="service indent">
    	<div class="ss-like"><h2>Social</h2></div>
        <p>Need help with your social media? From posting strategy, to growing engagement, to understanding what metrics to pay attention to (and which are meaningless). I can also help with starting and monitoring social ad campaigns.</p> 
    </section>
    
   <section class="service">
   		<div class="ss-piechart"><h2>Analytics</h2></div>
       	<p>How do you know if your website is successful? By setting goals and measuring success with site analytics. This is key for all websites, not just e-commerce. Keep track of important metrics and see how they improve over time.</p>
